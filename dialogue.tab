ch1_s2_3_8784ab5f		Though I'm not doing it because I'm a healer. I simply wanted to hug Maximiano. He's just so cute!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	165	"[what]"
ch1_s2_3_77ae32a4	m	Ahhhh....!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	166	m "[what]"

ch1_s2_5_078e6b5b		We giggle happily like two schoolgirls.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	217	"[what]"
ch1_s2_5_6d669955		What? There's nothing wrong with appreciating how handsome our clients are. After all, we're helping their pets, not them.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	218	"[what]"

ch1_s3_a86703c2	c	Now, who's next?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	236	c "[what]"
ch1_s3_8552f7f7		I step into the waiting room of the clinic with a bright smile on my face.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	237	"[what]"

ch1_s3_1_4676e7b0		Wonsh are usually quite independent and don't want to be carried.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	251	"[what]"

ch1_s3_3a_9cfb5d37	c	All done!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	340	c "[what]"
ch1_s3_3a_075716ed	"Lemurin's Owner"	Thank you, oh thank you, healer!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	341	"Lemurin's Owner" "[what]"
ch1_s3_3a_36860285		The lemurin's owner pays for the services and leaves, thanking us multiple times.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	342	"[what]"
ch1_s3_3a_f9cdf82c	v	Excellent job!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	344	v "[what]"
ch1_s3_3a_46f0277d	c	Well, thank you!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	345	c "[what]"
ch1_s3_3a_fcbba9fe		I leave for the waiting room to see who's up next.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	352	"[what]"
ch1_s4_56e52b62		With no more pets to heal, Valencia and I take a break for lunch.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	358	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3b590a37		Later that day, after we've already closed the clinic for the day, and started our clean-up routine, Valencia smiles at me brightly.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	363	"[what]"
ch1_s4_a44b0ef8	v	Another day of work successfully completed!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	365	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_c9577805	c	Today was a great day!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	372	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_d9a0389d		I can’t help the bright smile that appears on my face. I love my job and it brings me a lot of satisfaction.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	373	"[what]"
ch1_s4_6033bdcf	v	Yes, and no major surgeries-	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	375	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_0a129885		Our happiness is interrupted by loud banging on the entrance door.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	379	"[what]"
ch1_s4_eb73adb8		It’s past opening hours, but that’s not the first time we find ourselves in this situation.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	380	"[what]"
ch1_s4_43db7d1c		I can’t say I’m surprised. Everything has gone too smoothly today.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	382	"[what]"
ch1_s4_53c56f13	c	Today could have been better, but at least we made no major mistakes.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	386	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_e7ba3b44		I smile at her softly. It certainly hasn’t been the best day in the history of the clinic, but still, I love my job.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	387	"[what]"
ch1_s4_496b52ed	v	Yes, and no major surgeries-	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	389	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_9219289f		Our conversation is interrupted by loud banging on the entrance door.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	392	"[what]"

ch1_s4_d5590185		I can’t say I’m surprised.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	395	"[what]"
ch1_s4_fbbb1b85	c	You might have said that too soon.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	398	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_5b2ba77b	v	Oh no...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	400	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_5cc546a1		I make my way to the entrance door, Valencia following me closely behind.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	410	"[what]"
ch1_s4_c094a410	"???"	Healer! We need your help!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	411	"???" "[what]"
ch1_s4_1d48425e		There is a panicked man wearing a hard hat and plaid shirt on the outside of the entrance.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	413	"[what]"
ch1_s4_0b8c62a9		A lumberjack? But I see no sick animal with him. Oh no, is this an emergency call?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	414	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3fee2a29	c	I'm here. How can I help?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	416	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_0c876a35	"Lumberjack"	There's a burning bird in the forest just outside of town!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	418	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_de317604	"Lumberjack"	We were working - cutting trees and we found it there, lying there in a clearing!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	419	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_7dedd29e	"Lumberjack"	I swear we've done nothing! But it's on fire!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	420	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_a26dd014		That can't be what I think it is. I exchange a worried glance with Valencia.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	421	"[what]"
ch1_s4_4d666d5b	c	Hold on, please don't panic. I'm not blaming you for anything.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	423	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_6c177ad4	c	Tell me the state of the patient. Does it have any wounds?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	424	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_60b4e2b0	"Lumberjack"	I don't know...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	425	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_a7f086d3	c	Has no one looked closely at the creature?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	427	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_aa4d97b6	"Lumberjack"	No one dared to approach it! It's an inferno!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	428	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_3a8036b7		The man looks shocked at my suggestion. I sigh, too tired to hide my annoyance.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	430	"[what]"
ch1_s4_affc562a		Well, sometimes indifference is better than messing something up while trying to help.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	431	"[what]"
ch1_s4_7120e519	c	Val, get the flying stretcher, my toolbox and four fire resistance potions.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	433	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_63948e1e	v	On it!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	435	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_c882dc87		Valencia leaves to prepare what we need to help our new patient.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	439	"[what]"
ch1_s4_9a5fca9e		It's time to try to calm down the man and get as much information out of him as I can.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	441	"[what]"
ch1_s4_2_f197d3c6	c	Can you tell me where exactly you found the burning bird?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	456	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_2_8a7d78f3	"Lumberjack"	Not far away from town, it took me ten minutes to run over here from there!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	457	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_2_b91dc60d		The man gestures to the left. That's indeed the way to the forest that surrounds the town.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	458	"[what]"
ch1_s4_2_cc63eae0		There are no magical forests this close to us.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	459	"[what]"
ch1_s4_2_c1d12b44		Magical forests are unstable, so there could be an explosion from the contact of the creature with the vegetation of such a forest.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	460	"[what]"
ch1_s4_2_8756fbbb		The man doesn't look wounded though, and I heard no explosions. So I don't think he's lying about the location.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	461	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3_53db5437	c	You said the forest is not burning from the fire of the patient...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	474	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_3_2d24dc5b	"Lumberjack"	I don't know how that's possible! The creature is clearly on fire!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	475	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_3_12ee5305		Well, I have my suspicions.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	476	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3_b460946c		If there is no forest fire - and I can't see one from here - it cannot be a fire elemental that took on the shape of a bird.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	477	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3_b760f418		That's good because a fire elemental is not a mythical animal.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	478	"[what]"
ch1_s4_3_e4d00098		It's an apparition made of pure magic of its corresponding element. There's nothing I could do to heal the force of nature.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	479	"[what]"
ch1_s4_4_771a0dcd	c	How long ago did you find the burning bird?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	492	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_4_c9a8c3a3	"Lumberjack"	Fifteen minutes ago! As soon as we saw the creature, we decided to go to you for help!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	493	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_4_9a062e77	c	Thank you for your faith in me.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	496	c "[what]"
ch1_s4_4_0c6cc659	"Lumberjack"	Of course, you're known as the best animal healer in town!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	497	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s4_4_f041d6df		I nod, happy that my fame is spreading. Though with great fame comes great responsibility, as I think I'm about to discover...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	498	"[what]"
ch1_s4_5_a607f7b5		After a while, Valencia comes back, the stretcher flying behind her.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	517	"[what]"
ch1_s4_5_7b77c12c	v	I have everything you've requested.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	518	v "[what]"
ch1_s4_5_c27d2670	c	Then let's go! No time to waste!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	519	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_cf187f99		We follow the man on the road leading out of town and soon we enter the forest. The trees rustle and move in the wind gently.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	536	"[what]"
ch1_s5_b3da0d6b		Nothing seems to indicate something bad has happened here.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	537	"[what]"
ch1_s5_a800293c	v	So... what do you think it is?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	538	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_7ea4cf88		Valencia takes me by the arm and we walk some distance behind the lumberjack.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	542	"[what]"
ch1_s5_b4524059		He looks over his shoulder, but shrugs and keeps walking when he sees we're still following.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	543	"[what]"
ch1_s5_0d922780	c	I asked him some questions while you were preparing.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	544	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_1666e1cd	v	And?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	545	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_1366bd40	c	Well, first things first he seems like an honest man.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	546	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_a98d474f	c	I don't think he's lying about what he saw in the forest... which can only mean one thing.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	547	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_28907149	c	The forest around here is not magical, so it could very well catch on fire if he were dealing with a fire elemental.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	548	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_6f0c54a0	v	But it didn't?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	549	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_58fc962f	c	No, it didn't. We would see the smoke from a distance.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	550	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_77f0fb62	c	That means the fire the creature is producing is magical itself, so we are dealing with a mythical animal.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	551	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_28e521b5	v	There is only one fiery bird I know that's not a fire elemental and that's...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	552	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_8e7e6671	c	A phoenix, yes?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	553	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_4fec68d7		We exchange worried glances when I give voice to what we are both suspecting.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	554	"[what]"
ch1_s5_bc640bcc	v	But no one has seen a phoenix in decades!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	556	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_01ea9b83	c	That's one of the things that worries me. Will we be able to heal it?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	557	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_118d50b0	v	I've only learned phoenix anatomy in books...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	559	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_772beb9f	c	Same here. I have no practical experience with such advanced beings.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	561	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_e248bdd7	c	I was present once when a dragon was cured, but the only thing used back then was a lot of magic.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	562	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_738579ba	c	And I really mean it when I say a lot of magic.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	563	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_ff65f44b	c	They had to use a huge magical crystal and ten people had to channel healing magic through it.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	564	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_3d46583b	c	Only then did the spell to have enough power to not burn out mid-way.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	565	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_5b2ba77b	v	Oh no...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	567	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_88451f45	c	I hope I can do something for the phoenix, anything before it's too late.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	569	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_65bd57b8	v	Let's not lose hope just yet. You're an excellent healer!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	571	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_c455c4a7	c	Thank you, but sometimes skill itself isn't enough.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	573	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_660eabc2	c	There's one more thing worrying me...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	575	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_66f66762	v	Yes?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	576	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_912f53d7	c	Why is a phoenix on the brink of death in the first place? What was strong enough to cause such an injury?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	577	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_7d29542f		We stare at each other in grim silence. There's few animals I consider strong enough to cause harm to a phoenix...	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	579	"[what]"
ch1_s5_f4366b56		And the presence of any of them so close to human homes is worrying.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	580	"[what]"
ch1_s5_3351572d	v	I hope we'll be able to find out from the type of injuries it has.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	581	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_cfc438cf	c	Indeed.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	582	c "[what]"
ch1_s5_b73f5837		The lumberjack stops in front of us, and gestures to the left.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	583	"[what]"
ch1_s5_20821989	"Lumberjack"	We need to get off this path here! Come on, ladies!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	584	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s5_0ce91a6e	v	We're coming!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	585	v "[what]"
ch1_s5_b5a57c4e		We leave the road and enter the forest proper. After walking for a few minutes we hear the worried voices of multiple people.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	589	"[what]"
ch1_s5_b2980e9c		A few steps more and we see a clearing with lumberjacks gathered around a campfire.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	591	"[what]"
ch1_s5_0315ab79	"Lumberjack"	The healer is here!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	593	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s5_21e9273e		The people greet us with excitement.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	596	"[what]"
ch1_s5_e5bf5eb2		After saying hello, we follow the man who took us here a bit further into the forest... until we reach another clearing.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	597	"[what]"
ch1_s6_314459a1	c	By the gods!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	608	c "[what]"
ch1_s6_8cc3f0a7		Shock paralyses me when I see the phoenix lying in the middle of the foliage.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	610	"[what]"
ch1_s6_658c845e		Power is radiating off the creature - a magnificent, fearsomely beautiful being.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	611	"[what]"
ch1_s6_67d64136		I force myself to approach, knowing that even when hurt it could so easily kill me.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	612	"[what]"
ch1_s6_d7ee2964		I remind myself it's my job to help no matter what.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	613	"[what]"
ch1_s6_873fa5ef		When I see the extent of the phoenix' injuries, I wonder how it's still alive. It must be in a lot of pain.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	614	"[what]"
ch1_s6_951116c7		Numerous cuts all around its body, feathers plucked out. It lies there unconscious.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	615	"[what]"
ch1_s6_c76ab09a		There is also some sort of magic attached to its body. It's floating around the wounds, a dark shadow.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	616	"[what]"
ch1_s6_be46e15b		Curiosity overwhelming me, I put my finger into the swirling mass.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	617	"[what]"
ch1_s6_1375def8	c	Ow!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	621	c "[what]"
ch1_s6_5a8e0b4c		Rather than a burn, it feels like a bite. But when I examine my hand there is no sign of injury. Did it bite my magical aura directly?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	622	"[what]"
ch1_s6_2046e8f7		For a moment I worry it might damage me somehow, but soon it stops hurting altogether.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	623	"[what]"
ch1_s6_d0313530	c	Valencia, please bring the stretcher.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	625	c "[what]"
ch1_s6_63948e1e	v	On it!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	627	v "[what]"
ch1_s6_632340d9		We brought the fire resistance potions with us, but if it's a phoenix there is no point in using them.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	628	"[what]"
ch1_s6_d4be2782		The creature won't burn the stretcher. Even in this severely wounded condition it seems to have control over its own flames.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	629	"[what]"
ch1_s6_87653d6f		Phoenixes only burn things with their fire when they want to.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	630	"[what]"
ch1_s6_3dd08d3e		The will of this one must be strong, since it's still protecting the world from itself.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	631	"[what]"
ch1_s6_6b640bce	c	Hey! Could you help us pack the creature onto the stretcher?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	633	c "[what]"
ch1_s6_438d57f0	c	It won't burn you, but watch out for the swirling black magic! It's painful.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	634	c "[what]"
ch1_s6_930add78		The lumberjacks look scared, but the man who walked us here and another approach.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	640	"[what]"
ch1_s6_9951365b	"Lumberjack"	Understood. We'll help.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	641	"Lumberjack" "[what]"
ch1_s6_f9a615a8		I direct the two men on how to grab the bird properly. In no time it's on our stretcher and we set it to floating again.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	642	"[what]"
ch1_s6_e5c24ee5		We say our goodbyes. The lumberjacks seem relieved that the problem is out of their hands now.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	643	"[what]"
ch1_s6_dfff1f26		The stretcher floats behind it as we make our way back to the clinic.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	645	"[what]"
ch1_s7_ce0c17d5	c	Let's lay the phoenix on the table.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	657	c "[what]"
ch1_s7_49b851de	v	Yes!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	658	v "[what]"
ch1_s7_5c5056e5		We carefully move the patient from the stretcher to the surgery table.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	659	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_5fb131ca		We try everything we can. Hours pass by. Whenever we manage to heal a wound, it opens again.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	669	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_4a18a84b	c	It must be the dark magic that's attached to the phoenix's body.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	671	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_be8a95aa	v	You're right. We need someone magically stronger than us to join us and help detach whatever that darkness is from the patient.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	672	v "[what]"
ch1_s7a_4bc92835		Someone magically stronger... but whom should I call? I'm stronger than all the other healers in town.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	673	"[what]"

ch1_s7a_e69e42b8	c	No.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	676	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_6e815b98		I answer quickly. I don't want to call on that person for any reason.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	677	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_7c00631e	c	He's in Gerla anyway. Do you think he would come to Girasol just because I need something?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	679	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_a2af704a	v	Yes, he will.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	681	v "[what]"
ch1_s7a_049fd9a6		Valencia answers with a bright smile. I stare at her like she just grew a second head.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	683	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_5eed3998	c	Do you hear yourself? He lives in Gerla's capital now, that's a week's journey from here!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	684	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_d16e44b7	v	Not if he uses a portal!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	685	v "[what]"
ch1_s7a_d373bfdf	c	But that's so expensive!	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	686	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_09de9716	v	Diedriech isn't exactly poor, is he?	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	687	v "[what]"
ch1_s7a_3236cbb8		Well no, he certainly isn't poor. Diedriech is about as rich as I am.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	689	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_43f5ad2a		My parents gifted me this whole building when I graduated with flying colors.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	690	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_a75ec517		Considering that, Diedriech definitely has the money for a portal.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	691	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_4fff3f0f	c	I still don't think that's a good idea.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	693	c "[what]"
ch1_s7a_bb8498dc	v	If he can't come, no biggie. But trust me, he will be happy that you want to rely on him for something.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	695	v "[what]"
ch1_s7a_1eab8d5e		I can't understand why he would be.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	697	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_c78d171e		Diedriech and I have been rivals throughout all of our university years. We were like fire and water, always bickering.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	698	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_099fb2b8		Somehow the Gerlan never left me alone, always coming to me to tease me about this and that.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	699	"[what]"

ch1_s7a_e046be5a		I look at the phoenix, lying there on my table, hurt and dying.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	705	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_e246ef03		The thing that's stopping me from calling Diedriech is... pride. And that's stupid. I have to put those uncomfortable feelings aside.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	706	"[what]"
ch1_s7a_ef12fd8b	c	I'll call him.	game/chapters/ch1_s1-7.rpy	707	c "[what]"

ch1_s13_2dacf8dd		I didn't train myself to have them, nor did I try to influence them. I'm simply myself in those dreams, I'm present.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	8	"[what]"
ch1_s13_89dc19f7		The difference is, I know the things that are happening aren't real.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	9	"[what]"
ch1_s13_b74a8d94		I'm walking through the forest again, following the road I was on the other day.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	15	"[what]"

ch1_s13_max_33f533ff		The scenery changes, surprising me. We are in the same forest but in broad daylight.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	47	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_e2322808	m	Is everything okay?!	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	49	m "[what]"
ch1_s13_max_2fe28a57		Maximiano runs closer to me and touches my hand. His touch is warm, and it doesn't feel unpleasant.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	52	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_54880bd0		Wait, this is a dream. Do I want to touch Maximiano more in real life? But... why?	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	54	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_b2d3664e	m	Miss Catalina...	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	56	m "[what]"
ch1_s13_max_6f146940		I realize my lack of response is making Maximiano worry. I squeeze his hand and smile brightly.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	58	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_5e8b2f33	c	Everything's okay. I'm happy to see you!	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	60	c "[what]"
ch1_s13_max_a433f848		Where's Graciella though? I always see Maximiano with his pet. It's weird to be here with him all alone.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	61	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_17693738		But it's also nice in a sense. He has no reason to be here today - Graciella is fine.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	62	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_bd19d73c		He's not here to have me heal her. He's not worried about his pet either.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	63	"[what]"
ch1_s13_max_50e50e6a		He's here for me. And I... like that.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	64	"[what]"

ch1_s13_max_055cf523		Wait! What exactly am I dreaming about?!	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	76	"[what]"

ch1_s13_diedriech_2f34d4b9		Is my subconscious playing tricks with me? Do I actually want Diedriech to say such corny lines in real life?	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	92	"[what]"
ch1_s13_diedriech_00d683c2	c	You must really be sick. Something's wrong with your head.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	94	c "[what]"

ch1_s13_diedriech_e23c4e51		What?! But we bicker all the time. Wait, this is a dream. Do- do I want Diedriech to talk to me like this?	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	106	"[what]"
ch1_s13_diedriech_d19f855d	c	...	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	108	c "[what]"
ch1_s13_diedriech_b3a99da6		Suddenly I want to cry. Diedriech would never want to say such things to me in real life.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	110	"[what]"
ch1_s13_diedriech_e0c1da51		And that makes me so sad. I really wish things were different between us...	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	111	"[what]"

ch1_s13_diedriech_7e8781af		Now the pent-up feelings I have towards him will explode in my face again.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	116	"[what]"

ch1_s13_edmundo_0becf8ad		What does he mean? I look at him confused.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	138	"[what]"
ch1_s13_edmundo_7d75fffd		Edmundo takes a step closer to me, then another, until I have to raise my head to look up in his eyes. He's so much taller than me.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	141	"[what]"
ch1_s13_edmundo_cba78751		I blush. Again, it hits me how handsome he is, in his regal, timeless way.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	144	"[what]"

ch1_s13_edmundo_dee3f7ab		But wait... I'm dreaming. Is Edmundo just saying what I want to hear? Do I want to hear it from him in particular?	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	152	"[what]"

ch1_s14_09b36d52		I open my mouth to ask him again if he has a fever, but think better of it. If he's sick he'll tell me himself.	game/chapters/ch1_s13-16.rpy	182	"[what]"

ch1_s10_39f3d83b		Diedriech moves to the surgery table to examine our patient, mumbling under his breath.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	200	"[what]"
ch1_s10_b4782d11	d	I never thought I would see a phoenix...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	202	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_a6940f73	d	Look at his feather structure, what a wonderful specimen...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	204	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_bf1d232c	d	And the fact that it's on fire and not burning anything...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	206	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_5e84d87c		Seeing him examine Edmundo with such curiosity, even though the phoenix is lying there dying, pisses me off even more.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	207	"[what]"
ch1_s10_accd0886	c	This is no time for looking at it as if you're in a zoo!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	208	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_5870a52a	c	The patient is hurt! Can't you see the wounds?! And the dark energy swirling around?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	209	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_59c79f9a		Diedriech sighs then looks at me seriously.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	211	"[what]"
ch1_s10_6741c4ba	d	You're right. Let's get to work. Tell me what you already know.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	212	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_d6299f3c		Now that's the part of my rival I always admired - his ability to shut off emotions in an instant and get into work-mode.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	214	"[what]"
ch1_s10_bf79fd4c		By comparison I'm definitely a lot more emotion-driven.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	215	"[what]"
ch1_s10_5f4eab4a	c	Alright team, let's go.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	216	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_e20a4caf		I convey everything we've discovered and Diedriech listens and gives his own observations.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	217	"[what]"
ch1_s10_5e555f34	d	It seems to me if we apply enough magical power at once...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	220	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_d8cab973	d	We should be able to overwhelm the magic that's eating at its wounds.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	222	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_37e4d364	d	The alternative is of course unravelling the magic thread by thread.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	223	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_16f4b4cb	c	Tried that. It doesn't work. The pattern is too complicated and I can't find either the end nor the beginning.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	225	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_694b5817	c	With time I could probably figure it out, but...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	226	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_67b519b5	d	Time is what we don't have.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	227	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_49a9bbc9	v	How much time do you think the patient has left?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	229	v "[what]"
ch1_s10_a3506f66		I think for a moment.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	230	"[what]"
ch1_s10_feebc383	c	He seems much weaker than he was four hours ago...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	232	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_047d0a62		Was it because Edmundo used his powers to contact me through a dream?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	233	"[what]"

ch1_s10_ff78eb8d	v	Aren't phoenixes genderless?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	237	v "[what]"
ch1_s10_ba323801	c	This one seems to prefer being considered a male phoenix. His name is Edmundo Valdez. He contacted me in a dream.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	239	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_b1ee88de	d	You mean you dream-shared with the phoenix?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	241	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_3afb88d0		Why is Diedriech so angry all of a sudden?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	242	"[what]"
ch1_s10_72d0730d	c	I guess?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	243	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_7b8c37f9	d	Did you or did you not?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	244	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_d5d88f7e	c	I did! But I don't get why you're shouting at me all of a sudden!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	247	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_8f05d738		Diedriech mumbles something under his breath. I recognize some of the words as Gerlan curses.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	248	"[what]"
ch1_s10_c60be1ac	d	...never gets anything...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	249	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_3d4d501b	c	I beg your pardon?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	250	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_245a0a96	v	Please calm down...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	251	v "[what]"
ch1_s10_8df91995		He sighs, then rubs his temples. Soon after his calm self is back. How can he control his emotions so efficiently?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	253	"[what]"
ch1_s10_df50c97e	d	Nevermind. What did this Edmundo say to you in the dream?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	254	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_697ff1d8	c	You woke me up before he could say all he had to say, but he told me healing him was vital because... he has something important to do.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	256	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_85b22fc9	d	So nothing useful.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	257	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_1047669d	c	I would have healed him anyway, so I guess it wasn't anything that important.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	258	c "[what]"
ch1_s10_d0c82823	d	Alright, now that we've established we can only brute force the magic, let's focus on doing just that.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	259	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_4563b6f3	d	Our combined power should be enough. I hope.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	260	d "[what]"
ch1_s10_a1dc2540		I share the sentiment.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	261	"[what]"
ch1_s11_06ded429		It takes us the whole day to heal the phoenix. Before I realize it, the sun is setting once again.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	275	"[what]"
ch1_s11_cbe76d36		We used all of our magical power but the surgery is a success. I feel like I could collapse at any moment.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	276	"[what]"
ch1_s11_68936fe9		I look around. Valencia is sitting on the floor, sleeping.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	277	"[what]"
ch1_s11_4b59e13b		She couldn't keep up until the end so I told her to rest, but she didn't leave my side.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	278	"[what]"
ch1_s11_50d9a2c6		Diedriech looks exhausted.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	282	"[what]"
ch1_s11_ffdbe4a9	c	How many hours since last you slept?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	283	c "[what]"
ch1_s11_a20764df	d	Feels like the last time I slept was in the previous century.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	284	d "[what]"
ch1_s11_caa8c194	c	Just like old times, right?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	287	c "[what]"
ch1_s11_ee47f524	d	Just like old times.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	289	d "[what]"
ch1_s11_10f61d77		I remember all those sleepless nights trying to cram as much knowledge as we could into our brains for the exams.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	290	"[what]"
ch1_s11_93279240		Ah, university life. Sometimes I miss it.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	291	"[what]"
ch1_s11_4d337d58	c	Thank you for coming here, Diedriech.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	293	c "[what]"

ch1_s11_637064cb	d	It really means a lot to me that you-	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	296	d "[what]"
ch1_s11_a3442c95		Our awkward conversation is interrupted by a knock on the clinic's front door.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	301	"[what]"
ch1_s11_1fd3920a	c	Who in the world...?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	302	c "[what]"
ch1_s11_da14cb0b	d	Don't go! The clinic is closed. We put up the sign. You don't need...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	303	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_5a0e94ff		But before Diedriech can stop me, I'm already at the entrance door.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	313	"[what]"
ch1_s12_460f0b35		The knock repeats. I unlock the door.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	316	"[what]"
ch1_s12_1e8fa411	m	Ah...!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	321	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_6bec52cf		I see Maximiano with Graciella in his arms. One of Maximiano's arms is raised as if he wants to knock again.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	322	"[what]"
ch1_s12_be5ee92c		Graciella purrs in his arms happily, when she sees me.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	324	"[what]"
ch1_s12_d88342ee		I sigh, feeling more exhausted than I did a moment ago.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	326	"[what]"
ch1_s12_b43eae3f	c	...I guess I told you to come here today...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	327	c "[what]"
ch1_s12_7f253fab	m	I'm sorry, Miss Catalina, I didn't realize you were busy... it's just that Graciella needs her treatment and...	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	329	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_331328d3	c	It's okay.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	331	c "[what]"
ch1_s12_277ca85d	d	It's not okay.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	333	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_bb4bc470		Diedriech steps in right behind me, putting a hand on my shoulder.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	337	"[what]"
ch1_s12_f5df7df1		I stare at him, surprised to see that he is giving Maximiano a disapproving look.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	338	"[what]"
ch1_s12_8a87fe44		But when I look at Maximiano again... his expression mirrors Diedriech's. I thought he would be intimidated by my rival.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	342	"[what]"
ch1_s12_efc469de		Many people were back in our school years. Yet, Maximiano doesn't seem shy at all.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	343	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3cccc32c		How peculiar.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	344	"[what]"
ch1_s12_0813551b	d	Give me the pet, I will take care of it.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	346	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_d999a752		Graciella hisses when she sees Diedriech's outstretched hands.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	350	"[what]"
ch1_s12_9f3909d0	m	No! Graciella doesn't like just anybody to touch her!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	351	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_12c4b7a7	d	Did you just call me 'just anybody'?! For your information I am-	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	352	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_02aa0772		Okay, it's time to stop this before the whole situation blows up in my face. I'm too tired to deal with it.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	354	"[what]"
ch1_s12_2_fb98e208		Before Diedriech does anything rash, I take Graciella off of Maximiano's arms.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	368	"[what]"
ch1_s12_2_66844749		She purrs happily, trying to get me to pet her. I stroke her behind her ear.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	371	"[what]"
ch1_s12_2_0e9376ba	m	See? She prefers Miss Catalina to treat her.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	372	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_2_3666e535	d	Catalina, you really shouldn't-	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	373	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_2_e5eb9019	c	It's okay, I'll take care of it quickly.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	375	c "[what]"
ch1_s12_2_1c64bfbf		I enter the doctor's room to see Valencia awake. She stands in the middle of the room, yawning.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	385	"[what]"
ch1_s12_2_825ded63	c	Valencia, could I ask you to do one more thing for me, before we retire for the night? Please hold Graciella for me.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	386	c "[what]"
ch1_s12_2_8344e114	v	Sure, sure.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	388	v "[what]"
ch1_s12_2_c8b28194		Diedriech and Maximiano enter the room after me, staring daggers at each other.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	397	"[what]"
ch1_s12_2_0f6f5d24		My rival really shouldn't treat my patient's owners like that. I need to speak to him about it. Later... when I'm less tired.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	398	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_9d0fca09		Diedriech knows what he's doing - he's a mythical animal healer too.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	402	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_1f93f305		I let him take Graciella, who puffs and tries to scratch him with her claws on the way to the doctor's room.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	407	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_0fc25c45	m	Hey! Will you really let this stranger manhandle my precious Graciella?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	408	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_ebdf727f	c	"This stranger" is a healer like me. He knows what he's doing.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	410	c "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_ff16ea52		Diedriech glances at me with a happy smile. Maximiano looks as angry as his pet. It would be funny if I wasn't so tired.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	413	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_fa8f6a5c		We enter the doctor's room to see Valencia awake and standing in the middle, yawning.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	426	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_20bb58a7	d	Valencia, could I ask you to do something for me - can you hold this ball of fur?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	427	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_ed7ced0f	d	What kind of treatment does this little monster need?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	429	d "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_1e572101	m	What did you call my Princess?!	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	430	m "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_e2ad358a		Diedriech laughs at Maximiano admitting he treats his pet like royalty. I can't help the smile that appears on my face. So cute.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	434	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_40a9461c	v	Graciella needs this injection.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	438	v "[what]"
ch1_s12_3_c1576e5d		Valencia passes the syringe along to Diedriech and he gives the injection.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	439	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_d846cbba		Graciella makes unhappy sounds throughout the process, but at least that distracts her from the jab.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	442	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_6822ee54		Before long, she's released from the doctor's "clutches" and jumps into Maximiano's arms.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	449	"[what]"
ch1_s12_3_8e5bfb4c	m	Thank you... I guess.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	450	m "[what]"

ch1_s12_4_0979c07b		That's even more suspicious. Where would he find a painting with such a rare mythical creature?	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	475	"[what]"
ch1_s12_4_10a49614		I'm too tired to hold a conversation. I'll ignore his comment for now.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	478	"[what]"
ch1_s12_5_a450e9cf		Diedriech looks at Maximiano suspiciously, but I shake my head and he drops the subject.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	482	"[what]"
ch1_s12_5_e5133537		Valencia holds Graciella for me, and I give the injection before she realizes what's happening to her.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	488	"[what]"
ch1_s12_5_f4fdcce9		She squeals in surprise, then jumps back into Maximiano's arms.	game/chapters/ch1_s8-12.rpy	489	"[what]"
