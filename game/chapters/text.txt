The navy-colored wonsh with the green underbelly is truly a beautiful creature. However, the red light in its head is dim, suggesting it must be in immense pain.
[Catalina Worried] “Can the owner of the wonsh please come in?"
[Wonsh’s Owner] “Thank you, Healer!"
[doctor’s room day]
The wonsh’s owner enters the doctor’s room, carrying his pet in his arms.
This is concerning as the species normally slithers on its own.
Wonsh are usually quite independent and don't want to be carried.
I share a worried look with Valencia.
The man sets his pet on the surgery table.
[Catalina Worried] “Before I take a look, could you tell me what happened?"
[Wonsh’s Owner] “My Mateo and I were playing catch in the fields."
[Wonsh’s Owner] “Suddenly Mateo hissed in pain and now he doesn’t want to move on his own."
[Catalina Worried] “Hmm…"
Time to put the wonsh under inspection then!
